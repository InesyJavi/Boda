  comment: "23/03/2019 - A Step Closer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find an internship in Spain and had to go to Toulouse as a backup plan to get closer to you (lol, if only I knew it was the worst city when it comes to public transportation). I still have good memories of that period, mostly because even though we were still far away from each other, we were able to see each other more often and without planning it 3 months in advance. Also, I had the coolest flat I have ever lived in.",

  comment: "17/08/2019 - Ich bin ein Berliner: Our first trip together in Berlin for your 24th birthday. As you remember, it didn't start as planned because you missed one flight and got overbooked on another... So you had to spend the night alone in an airport hotel for your birthday... But once you got there, we had such a wonderful weekend in the frenetic Berlin. I had booked a 5-star hostel thanks to Airbus' CE, and that was pretty cool, haha.",

  comment: "27/06/2020 - Barna aka Bar√ßa: The beginning of a long love story with my second lover... the beautiful city of Barcelona. This photo is from when you visited me for the first time after COVID, and we had to fake some documentation to say you were living with me. Me moving to this city is a big milestone in our relationship. After 2 years of being together, we were finally able to see each other often. I remember feeling so happy to be able to take the AVE and be in Zaragoza in 1h23... Now that I was living in Spain, I had so many things to discover with you about your culture, the language, the nature, etc. Remember, at that time, I didn't speak a word of Spanish and still had doubts about the fact that there were cold places in Spain. You helped me and taught me so many things without judging my ignorance, and I thank you and your family for that. Living here made me realize how much I love Spain and its culture, and I hope one day we can go back to live there together.",

From the beautiful Transylvania and the Dracula stories to the Soviet city of Bucharest, we had fun all the way through. But please, when dogs attack you, don't walk away like it's normal.",

From AlbaracAIN to Alquezar and the Aurin, your region is beautiful and full of diversity. I am so grateful that you and your family take the time to show me around and share your knowledge. You've passed your love of Aragon on to me.",

  comment: "16/07/2021 - Hiii Haaa! Yo Soy Mexicano!: Coming out of the pandemic, I had to convince you to go to Mexico that summer, and I don't regret it at all. This is our first 'big' trip together outside of Europe, and my head is still filled with wonderful images from this part of the world. I loved everything: the food, the culture, the landscapes, the cenotes, the history, and the Maya temples. But I think what made this even more special was sharing the experience with you. We had so much fun fooling around in our tiny car, driving on the dangerous roads of Yucatan (be careful of the bumps!!!!), having endless conversations, and basically creating wonderful memories together.",

Seeing these photos of the two most important people in my life makes me realize how lucky I am. During that trip to Lanzarote, you also had the chance to get to know my friends from Uni better. And let's be honest, Carla is a b****, and everyone knows that.",

From the weirdest hotel lost in the middle of the Vietnamese countryside (and your terrible night, hahahaha) to the 5-star hotel on a private island, and finally to Minh's amazing, kind, and generous family, this trip will always have a special place in my heart.",
